# MiniRPG
This is just a small RPG :)

It's pretty basic I've only spent some hours to create it.
The game engine includes two different characters, random damage within a range, critical hits, parrying, blocking with a health related blocking value.
After an attack the next attack is disabled for one second.
An additional idea would be to hurt yourself if you tap earlier to make it a reaction game instead of a tapping game.

Basically it supports custom player names and choosing characters. Only an input screen needs to be implemented.
